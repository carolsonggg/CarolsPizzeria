Papa’s Pizzeria: A Digital Remake

Description:
This project aims to recreate the gameplay mechanics of Papa’s Pizzeria, a classic flash-based time management game. Players will operate a virtual pizza shop, managing orders, customizing pizzas with toppings, baking, and slicing pizzas according to customer preferences. The game will feature:
- An intuitive order-taking and preparation interface.
- Drag-and-drop mechanics for topping placement.
- A scoring system evaluating accuracy, speed, and customer satisfaction.
- Increasing difficulty as players progress through levels.
- Although the graphics will be simplified compared to the original game, the focus will be on accurately replicating the mechanics and maintaining engaging gameplay.

Version Control / Backup Plan
To ensure regular backups, I will use GitHub for version control. A private repository will track all code changes, with daily commits documenting progress. This prevents data loss in case of computer issues and allows for easy collaboration or mentorship review.
