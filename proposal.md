# CarolsPizzeria
Carols’s Pizzeria!

Description:
This project aims to recreate the gameplay mechanics of Papa’s Pizzeria, a classic flash-based time management game. Players will operate a virtual pizza shop, managing orders, customizing pizzas with toppings, baking, and slicing pizzas according to customer preferences. The game will feature:
- An intuitive order-taking and preparation interface.
- Drag-and-drop mechanics for topping placement.
- A scoring system evaluating accuracy, speed, and customer satisfaction.
- Increasing difficulty as players progress through levels.
- Although the graphics will be simplified compared to the original game, the focus will be on accurately replicating the mechanics and maintaining engaging gameplay.

Here are the current screens that will be implemented:
1. Ordering. Here, the player will take the customers' orders with a time constraint. Possible penalty if a customer leaves due to no patience left over.
2. Baking. Here, the player will bake the crust in accordance to the order, ensuring not to burn it.
3. Topping. Here, the player will put on the sauce and toppings and make the cuts necessary, in accordance to the order.
4. Tasting. Here, the customer will give the player a score based on how well they did with the evenness of the toppings, the cuts, and how much their patience depreciated while they were waiting for their order to be taken.

Version Control / Backup Plan
To ensure regular backups, I will use GitHub for version control. A private repository will track all code changes, with daily commits documenting progress. This prevents data loss in case of computer issues and allows for easy collaboration or mentorship review.

Tech List
Python: Core programming language for implementing game logic.
CMU graphics? Pygame?
GitHub: For version control and regular backups.
